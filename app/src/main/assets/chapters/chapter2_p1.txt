You find Dr. Marco Fogg with ease as he stands out from the surrounding crowd, with a look that could only belong to a mad scientist. You explain the situation to him, playing the message once again and, to your surprise, he does not find it too odd and promptly accepts the task without questions.
Marco asks you to take a walk with him as he explains what he learned about the Artifact from all his years studying it, how it vibrates and glows slightly when exposed to Cesium-137, how it was responsible for the explosion that killed his wife, his relationship to his ancestor, what he knows about him and how exactly he will decode the information in Victoria’s message in order to send the user, a “more capable assistant”, to the past.
