You do not bring much to the past. A victorian era costume would have to do, and a few thousand fake old pounds would take care of the rest. The machine doesn’t look like much, a cage with a mess of wires surrounding it, but it would do. You walk in, standing on a rubber surface as Marco Fogg prepares his computer. 
The devices surrounding you start to buzz, rising in pitch and intensity and you start to feel really strange. Your body feels like it’s being torn apart but, as you turn to Fogg to ask him to stop, you see he is no longer there. Without warning, everything stops with a bang and a flash of light and you find yourself shaking, staring at a wet, sandstone floor, feeling the greatest hangover of your life.
