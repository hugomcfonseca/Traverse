After a glass of whiskey and an opium pipe causing him to become unconscious, you are sure Passepartout could never find his way to his master. You leave him, bumbling in the street, confused, and walk calmly towards the docks.
You find Phileas Fogg as he stands near the water watching, in the distance, his ship sailing away. You pretend to have suffered the same delay, as you present yourself to Fogg and you both search for a ship to board together. You successfully find one, giving you at last, some time alone with Fogg and his Artifact, without Passepartout watching over your shoulder.
