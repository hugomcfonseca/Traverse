In the journey through China, your chances to get the Artifact slowly dwindle. You simply follow Fogg, never finding good opportunities to strike and all of your attempts at stealing the Artifact failing. In Hong Kong, however, you decide that Passepartout, being a good and loyal servant, is responsible for many of your failures, and therefore, must be taken out of the picture if your mission is to be successful.
You invite him for a drink once more, pretending coincidence led you there and recalling the good times both of you shared in the sea. He tells you he must not take long since he has to warn his master that the ship he intents to board will leave earlier than expected. Lady Fortune has clearly smiled upon you, as you convince him to stay just a few more minutes.
