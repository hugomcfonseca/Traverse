After Fogg’s group arrives at Bombain, you discover that Passepartout has committed a crime by entering a sacred temple wearing his shoes. After they kick him out of their sacred house, you talk to the priests that witnessed the offense and convince them, with a small bribe, to travel to Calcuta, Fogg’s next destination, to stand in Passepartout’s trial, assuring them he would be arrested.
You quickly return to the chase after Fogg and Passepartout as they journey across India. 
On the way, they are forced to leave the train and continue on elephant; you find a horse, which allows you to continue following them.
Suddenly, the elephant stops. As you approach them, you find out Fogg has seen an ancient abandoned temple reclaimed by nature and being hammered by workers overwatched by British officials. 
On top of the temple you notice an odd blue diamond-shaped rock, sitting at a pedestal, almost calling for you; Fogg assumes it is an ancient priceless relic and devises a plan to remove it from the temple before it is destroyed. It must be the Artifact! Now seems to be the moment it was saved from destruction! You must act now. 
You run towards the temple, attempting not to be seen by Fogg and his group.
