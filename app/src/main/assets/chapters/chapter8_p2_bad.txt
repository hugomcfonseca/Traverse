As you hold the Artifact over your head ready to destroy it, you are arrested for impersonating an officer of the law and attempting to steal evidence. You are locked in a cell as you watch Fogg being released, since the real bank robber had been arrested 3 days before and the police had no other reason to keep him there. 
He would end up winning his bet as you stay trapped in the past, with the fate of mankind in your conscience.
