On the same train as Fogg, although a few carriages away, you read a newspaper article detailing a robbery that had taken place two months before and that it had yet been solved. It occurred in London, around the time Fogg started his journey, and the robber’s description matches Phileas Fogg’s appearance surprisingly well, which gives you an idea.

You would accuse Fogg of being the bank robber and arrest him the moment he stepped foot in British lands.
This time, you would finally succeed in your mission.
