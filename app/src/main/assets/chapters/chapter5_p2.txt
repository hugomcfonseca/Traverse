Sadly, your distraction with Fogg led to an officer noticing you. He asks what you are doing in such a place, informing you you cannot advance, that you are standing in British soil and orders you to leave the premises. Arguing does not stop his resolve and you give up when you see Passepartout climbing down from the temple, unnoticed, with the Artifact in his hands.
Angry and upset with your failure, you get on your horse and ride fast towards Calcuta, still hoping that the priests you sent there had arrived, providing you with another chance at taking the Artifact, this time from Fogg. 
You arrive before him and alerting the local police, you order the arrest of Fogg and Passepartout due to a religious crime.

When Fogg arrives the police does as requested, arresting Foggâ€™s party. The priests prove vital to convince the judge Passepartout committed a crime. 
Sadly, you are unable to reach the Artifact, as Fogg paid off his and his servants bail and continuing without delay, his journey with no major setback.

This was it. Your best chance of destroying the Artifact was gone.
Your resolve takes a blow, but stands firm. 
You have nothing to lose and your task is of vital importance. 
You continue the chase.
