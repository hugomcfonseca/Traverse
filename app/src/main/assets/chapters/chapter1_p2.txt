The woman, calling herself Victoria Fogg, informs you that she is a scientist from the year 2984 and that she needs your help, asking you to meet a Dr. Marco Fogg, living in Porto, Portugal.
That man is in possession of an important Artifact and is the only person smart enough to help her. 
She requires him to build a time machine that can send him or a more capable assistant to the past, to the time of Phileas Fogg, a relative of both Victoria and Marco, in order to destroy the Artifact he saved. That Artifact is, in fact, a sensor that informs an alien life that creatures on this planet have discovered nuclear fission, a process that releases Cesium-137, an isotope that the sensor can detect, proving that an intelligent species lives on Earth. It is in the aliensâ€™ interest to destroy creatures that could someday pose a challenge to them.
You search the town for Dr. Marco Fogg, not knowing what to make of the message you just received. Perhaps this is a game, a prank, maybe there are cameras recording what you decide to do.
You want to put up a good show.
