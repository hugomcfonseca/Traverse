As you arrive to 1872, standing in a dock as people around you wait for a steamer to arrive, you face your first dilemma - blending in and discovering a way to find and follow Phileas Fogg in his trip around the world. Suddenly, a lady in a fantastic, complex dress bumps into you, quickly begging forgiveness, almost screaming “Pardon me, detective.” That confused lady gave you an idea - you would disguise yourself as an officer of the law, blending with the police force in order to chase Fogg in his journey. You find a way to send a telegram to the Commissioner of Police at Scotland Yard, in London, requesting a warrant of arrest for Phileas Fogg.

As you start looking around, a man stops in front of you. He asks you where he can find the consul’s office to get his master’s passport stamped. You can’t believe your eyes and the extreme coincidence, when the passport he shows you shows the name “Phileas Fogg”. This man must be his servant, Passepartout. You help him reach the office and follow him back to the Mongolia ship to start your chase around the world and around a completely different time period.
